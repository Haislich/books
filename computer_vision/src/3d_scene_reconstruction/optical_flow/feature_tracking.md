# Feature Tracking

Feature tracking in computer vision involves detecting and following distinctive points (features) across a series of images or video frames. The goal is to track these points as they move through space and time, maintaining their identity across frames.

Once features are detected, described, and matched between frames, the motion of each matched feature can be tracked. This involves estimating the motion vector or transformation that aligns each feature with its match in subsequent frames.
