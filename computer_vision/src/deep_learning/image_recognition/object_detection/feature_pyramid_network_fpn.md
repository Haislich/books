# Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)

**FPN** builds on Faster R-CNN by enhancing feature extraction:

1. Instead of using just the top feature layer, FPN uses a **pyramid of feature maps** from different stages of the network.
2. This allows detection at multiple scales, improving performance on objects of varying sizes.
