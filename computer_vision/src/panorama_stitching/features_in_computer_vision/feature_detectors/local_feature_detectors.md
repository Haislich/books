# Local Feature Detectors

Local features capture information about specific points or small regions in the image. These features are particularly useful for tasks that require precise structure or content information from parts of the image. Applications include:

- **Object recognition**: Useful for recognizing objects that appear at different sizes, rotations, or with partial occlusion.
- **Image matching**: Align or stitch images by identifying similar patterns or keypoints across images.
