# Contrastive Learning

**Contrastive learning** is a popular form of self-supervised learning, where the model is trained to distinguish between similar and dissimilar data points. The goal is to bring similar examples (called **positive pairs**) closer together in the representation space, while pushing dissimilar examples (called **negative pairs**) farther apart.
