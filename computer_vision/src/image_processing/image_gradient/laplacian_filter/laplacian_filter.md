# Laplacian Filter

The Laplacian filter is a second-order derivative filter that detects areas of rapid intensity change. Unlike first-order methods (such as Sobel), which measure the gradient of intensity, the Laplacian measures the rate of change of the gradients, offering a different perspective on edge detection.
