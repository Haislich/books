# Key Steps in Feature Matching

1. **Feature Detection**:  
   Features or keypoints are first detected in each image. These points represent areas of the image with significant texture or structure (e.g., corners or edges), which can be reliably identified and are typically invariant to transformations like scaling, rotation, or changes in illumination.

2. **Feature Description**:  
   Each detected feature is described using a feature descriptor. Descriptors encode the appearance of the feature and its surrounding region in a compact form, making them robust against transformations. The goal is for the same feature to have a similar descriptor even when captured under different conditions.

3. **Feature Matching**:  
   Once features are described, the descriptors are matched across different images. This involves finding pairs of descriptors that are closest in terms of a chosen distance metric. Common metrics include:
   - **Euclidean distance**: Used for real-valued descriptors like SIFT and SURF. It calculates the straight-line distance between two points in a high-dimensional space.
   - **Hamming distance**: Used for binary descriptors like ORB and BRIEF. It counts the number of differing bits between two binary strings, making it computationally efficient.
