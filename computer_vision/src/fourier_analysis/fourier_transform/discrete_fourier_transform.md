# Discrete Fourier Transform

In image processing, Fourier transforms are primarily used in their discrete form, known as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Since images do not naturally repeat across boundaries, they are treated as aperiodic signals, making the Fourier transform ideal for analyzing such non-periodic data.

The DFT converts an image to the frequency domain, facilitating operations such as filtering, enhancement, and noise reduction. For digital images, which consist of discrete pixel values, the DFT is used. The DFT is typically represented through its magnitude and phase components:

- **Magnitude Spectrum**: Shows the amplitude of each frequency component in the signal, indicating how much of each frequency is present in the original signal.
- **Phase Spectrum**: Indicates the shift or displacement of each frequency component relative to the start of the signal.
