# Up sampling

Upsampling is a specific type of resampling where the goal is to increase the number of pixels in an image, typically to make the image larger or to match a certain resolution requirement.
This is done through interpolation methods such as nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, etc., which calculate and fill in the pixel values that didnâ€™t exist in the original image.
