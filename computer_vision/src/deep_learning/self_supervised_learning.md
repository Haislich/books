# Self-Supervised Learning

**Supervised learning** relies on large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Moreover, manually labeled datasets often contain classification errors due to human mistakes. **Self-supervised learning** is a paradigm designed to overcome these limitations by learning from **unlabeled data**. It does this by automatically generating labels from the data itself, allowing models to learn useful representations that can be transferred to downstream tasks such as classification, object detection, or depth estimation.
