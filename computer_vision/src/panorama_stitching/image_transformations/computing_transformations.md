# Computing Transformations

Computing a transformation involves determining the transformation matrix \( T \) that maps points from image \( A \) to image \( B \), given a set of matched feature points between the two images. The goal is to find the matrix that best fits the transformation using methods like least squares, which minimizes the error from imperfect feature matching.
