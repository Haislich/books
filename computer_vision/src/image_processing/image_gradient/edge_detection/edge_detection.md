# Edge Detection

An "optimal edge detector" aims to accurately identify true edges while minimizing false detections and the effects of noise. According to John Canny's criteria (Canny, 1986), an optimal edge detector should have:

- **Good Detection**: Detect as many true edges as possible.
- **Good Localization**: Ensure detected edges are close to the actual edges.
- **Minimal Response**: Avoid multiple responses to a single edge.
