# Nyquist Sampling Theorem

The Nyquist Sampling Theorem states:

> To perfectly reconstruct a continuous signal from its samples, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in the signal (the Nyquist rate).

When a signal is undersampled (i.e., sampled below the Nyquist rate), higher frequencies are misinterpreted as lower frequencies, leading to distortions known as aliasing.
