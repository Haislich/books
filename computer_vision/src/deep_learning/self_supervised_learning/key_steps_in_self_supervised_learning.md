# Key Steps in Self-Supervised Learning

1. **Pretext Task**:
   - The pretext task is an auxiliary task where labels are derived automatically from the data. It is not the final goal but serves as a means to force the model to learn meaningful representations of the data.
   - Examples of pretext tasks include predicting missing parts of an image, predicting the relative position of patches in an image, or reconstructing color from grayscale images.

2. **Model Training**:
   - The model learns to solve the pretext task using a standard loss function (such as cross-entropy or regression losses). During this process, the model builds an internal representation of the data, learning features like textures, edges, spatial contexts, or semantic relationships.

3. **Fine-tuning**:
   - Once trained on the pretext task, the model can be fine-tuned for the **main task** (e.g., image classification or object detection) with a smaller amount of labeled data. This step leverages the learned representations from self-supervised learning to improve performance in the supervised task.
