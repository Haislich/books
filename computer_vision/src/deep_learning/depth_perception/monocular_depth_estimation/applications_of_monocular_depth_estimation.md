# Applications of Monocular Depth Estimation

1. **Autonomous Vehicles**:
   - Monocular depth estimation is used in autonomous driving to perceive the environment and understand the distance of obstacles, road surfaces, and pedestrians. While stereo cameras and LiDAR systems provide more accurate depth information, monocular depth estimation is more cost-effective and can complement these systems.

2. **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)**:
   - Monocular depth estimation helps create more immersive AR/VR experiences by allowing the system to accurately understand and manipulate the environment in 3D.

3. **Robotics**:
   - Robots can use monocular depth estimation to navigate their environment, avoid obstacles, and interact with objects, especially in situations where depth sensors like LiDAR are too expensive or impractical.

4. **3D Scene Reconstruction**:
   - Monocular depth estimation can be used to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images, making it useful for fields like urban planning, architecture, and archaeology, where creating 3D models from photos is essential.
