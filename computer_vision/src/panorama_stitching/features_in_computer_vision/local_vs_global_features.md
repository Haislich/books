# Local vs. Global Features

Features extracted from images can be broadly categorized into:

- **Local Features**:  
  Focus on specific points or regions within the image, often used for tasks like matching or object detection.
  
- **Global Features**:  
  Capture broader, overall characteristics of the image and are typically used for tasks such as scene recognition or image classification.
