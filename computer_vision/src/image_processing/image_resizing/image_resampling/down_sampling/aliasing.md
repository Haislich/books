# Aliasing

Aliasing is a phenomenon that occurs when a signal is sampled without sufficient resolution to accurately capture its high-frequency components.
In the context of image processing, aliasing manifests as visual artifacts—such as jagged edges or moiré patterns—when high-frequency details (fine textures or sharp transitions) are not adequately represented due to undersampling.
