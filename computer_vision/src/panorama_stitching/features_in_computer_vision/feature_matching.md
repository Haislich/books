# Feature Matching

Feature matching is the process of identifying corresponding keypoints between different images. It is a critical step in various computer vision applications, such as stereo vision, object recognition, motion tracking, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction. The goal of feature matching is to establish correspondences between features extracted from different images, even when those images are captured under different conditions like varying scale, orientation, or lighting.
