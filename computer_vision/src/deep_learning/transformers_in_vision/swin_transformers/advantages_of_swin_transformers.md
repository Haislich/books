# Advantages of Swin Transformers

- **Computational Efficiency**: By using local windows and shifted windows, Swin Transformer reduces the computational burden, making it much more efficient than ViT for large images.
- **Scalability**: Its hierarchical structure makes it flexible for a variety of vision tasks, from low-resolution classification to high-resolution segmentation and detection.
