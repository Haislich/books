# Interpolation techniques

## Nearest Neighbor

Nearest neighbor interpolation is a method of upsampling that interpolates new pixel values depending only on the closest pixels.
Is one of the fastes and simplest methods that can be used.

## Bilinear interpolation

Bilinear interpolation is a resampling method used in image processing to determine the intensity of a new pixel based on a weighted average of the $4$ nearest pixels in the original image.

## Bicubic interpolation

Bilinear interpolation is a resampling method used in image processing to determine the intensity of a new pixel based on a weighted average of the $16$ nearest pixels in the original image.
