# Relation to Human Vision

The human eye contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that sample the continuous visual field. These cells are densely packed in the fovea (central region) and sparse toward the periphery, allowing for high-resolution sampling where focus is directed, akin to a higher sampling rate at the fovea. Just as in digital sampling, improper sampling in the visual system can lead to aliasing, such as when viewing fine patterns or distant scenes.
