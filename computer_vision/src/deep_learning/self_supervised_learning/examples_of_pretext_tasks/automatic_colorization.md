# Automatic Colorization

Another example of a pretext task in computer vision is **automatic colorization**, where the model learns to take a grayscale image as input and predict a realistic colorized version of the image. This forces the model to understand high-level semantics and textures.

- **Key Benefit**: The model learns rich semantic features, as colorization requires understanding the content and context of the objects in the image to apply realistic colors.
