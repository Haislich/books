# Image Reconstruction with Laplacian Pyramid

The Laplacian pyramid allows for a perfect reconstruction of the original image. By storing the difference between each level of the Gaussian pyramid and its upsampled version, the Laplacian pyramid effectively tracks the exact data lost during each downsampling step. When reconstructing the image, these differences are added back, step by step, to the upsampled images, allowing for an exact reconstruction of the original image.
