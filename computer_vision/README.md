# Introduction

This book is the result of the lesson of Vision and Perception at University Sapienza of Rome, in my MsC in artificial Intelligence and robotics.

## The need of computer vision

The goal of computer vision is to enable computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and to act or make decisions based on that information.
Essentially, it aims to replicate and automate the capabilities of the human visual system.

## Computer Vision vs. Computer Graphics

Computer Vision is about interpreting and understanding the content of an image or video.
It aims to replicate the human visual system to recognize, detect, and understand objects and scenes in images or videos.

Computer Graphics is the creation and manipulation of images and videos using computers.
It focuses on generating visual content through rendering, animation, and visualization techniques.
Essentially, while computer vision is about understanding images, computer graphics is about creating them.

## Computer Vision vs. Image Processing

Image Processing involves performing operations on images to enhance them or extract useful information.
It deals with basic transformations like resizing, filtering, and color adjustments, and is often used as a preprocessing step in computer vision workflows to improve the quality of input data for better analysis.

Computer Vision uses the outputs of image processing to perform more complex tasks such as object recognition, scene reconstruction, and more.
It goes beyond processing the image to understanding the context and elements within the visual data.

## Computer Vision vs. Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn from a vast amount of data.
Deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have become fundamental in modern computer vision tasks, enabling advancements in recognition, detection, and classification.

Computer Vision is one of the fields that has greatly benefited from deep learning, applying these algorithms to achieve significant improvements in visual understanding and analysis.
However, computer vision is not limited to deep learning alone and includes a variety of techniques from image processing, pattern recognition, and geometric modeling.
