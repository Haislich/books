# Fourier Analysis

Fourier analysis is a mathematical method used to decompose functions or signals into sinusoids of different frequencies.

Fourier analysis plays a crucial role in computer vision by providing methods to process, analyze, and manipulate images in the frequency domain. Some of the most important applications are:

- **Image Filtering**: Fourier analysis allows for efficient high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filtering, which can be used to remove noise, blur, or enhance image features.
- **Image Compression**: By transforming an image into its frequency components, redundant or less important frequencies can be removed, leading to effective compression without significant loss of quality.
- **Feature Extraction**: Fourier transforms can highlight periodic patterns and textures in an image, which are useful for object recognition and classification.
- **Edge Detection**: Edges in images can be detected by focusing on specific frequency ranges within the Fourier transform of an image.
