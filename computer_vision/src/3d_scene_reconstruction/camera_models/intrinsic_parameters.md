# Intrinsic Parameters

Intrinsic parameters define the internal characteristics of the camera, including:

- **Focal length (f)**: The distance between the camera sensor and the lens, affecting the field of view and magnification.
- **Principal point (c_x, c_y)**: The point on the image sensor corresponding to the camera's optical center.
- **Skew coefficient**: Describes the skewness between the x and y pixel axes, ideally zero in well-calibrated cameras.
- **Distortion coefficients**: Parameters that account for lens distortions, including radial and tangential distortions that warp the image.
