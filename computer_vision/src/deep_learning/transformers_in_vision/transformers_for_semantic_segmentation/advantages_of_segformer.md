# Advantages of SegFormer

- **Efficiency**: SegFormer achieves high performance while being computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications and use on devices with limited resources (e.g., mobile devices).
- **Multi-scale Processing**: Its ability to handle information at different scales ensures good performance across various image types, whether detailed (urban scenes) or broad (satellite images).
- **Simplicity**: The lack of convolutions in the decoder simplifies implementation and reduces computational costs.
