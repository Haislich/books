# Feature Detectors

Feature detectors are algorithms designed to identify points of interest in an image. These points, or "features," are typically locations where the image content changes significantly, such as edges, corners, or blobs. The primary goal of a feature detector is to locate salient points that are distinctive and invariant to transformations like translation, rotation, or scaling.
