# Homogeneous Coordinates

Homogeneous coordinates extend the representation of points by adding an extra dimension, allowing for more complex transformations, such as perspective changes. They also enable affine transformations, including translations, to be represented as matrix operations. Points at infinity, which are useful in perspective transformations, are represented by setting \( w = 0 \).
