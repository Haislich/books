# Filters

Filters are types of neighborhood operations designed to modify or enhance images through a defined set of rules or kernels.
Filters can be linear (like Gaussian or averaging filters) or non-linear (like median filters), each tailored to specific tasks such as smoothing, sharpening, or noise reduction.
