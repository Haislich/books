# Order Recognition

In order recognition tasks, the model is trained to predict the correct order of shuffled data. This task can be applied to different types of data:

- **Images**: The image is divided into several blocks, which are randomly shuffled. The modelâ€™s task is to reconstruct the correct order of these blocks, learning about spatial coherence and object integrity.
- **Videos**: Given a sequence of video frames, the model must predict their correct temporal order. This helps the model understand temporal dynamics and motion patterns.
- **Text**: The model predicts the correct sequence of sentences or paragraphs in a passage, learning syntactic and semantic coherence.
