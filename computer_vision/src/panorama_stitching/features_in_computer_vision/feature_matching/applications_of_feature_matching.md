# Applications of Feature Matching

- **Image Stitching**:  
  In panorama creation, feature matching aligns overlapping images by finding corresponding points, allowing the images to be stitched together seamlessly.
  
- **Object Recognition**:  
  Feature matching allows for recognizing objects across different images, even when they are rotated or viewed from different angles.
  
- **3D Reconstruction**:  
  By matching keypoints between multiple views of the same scene, depth information can be estimated, enabling the reconstruction of 3D models from 2D images.

- **Motion Tracking**:  
  In video analysis, feature matching helps track objects or features across consecutive frames, facilitating motion tracking or optical flow estimation.
