# Convolution Theorem

The Convolution Theorem states that convolution in the time domain corresponds to multiplication in the frequency domain, and vice versa. This is particularly useful in signal and image processing, as convolution can be computationally expensive. Using the Fourier transform, convolution can be performed more efficiently:

- Apply the Fourier transform to both the signal and the filter.
- Multiply their transforms in the frequency domain.
- Apply the inverse Fourier transform to the result.

This approach is much faster than directly performing convolution in the spatial domain, especially for large data sets.
