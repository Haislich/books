# First Datasets

1. **MNIST**: A simple dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training and 10,000 test grayscale images of 28x28 pixels, labeled from 0 to 9.

2. **Caltech 101**: A dataset containing images from 101 different object categories, used for general object classification tasks. Each category contains around 40 to 800 images of various real-world objects, such as faces, cars, and animals.

3. **ImageNet**: One of the largest and most impactful datasets in the history of image classification, ImageNet has over 22,000 categories and 15 million labeled images. It is widely known for its annual **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)**, where deep learning models have set new benchmarks for image classification accuracy.
