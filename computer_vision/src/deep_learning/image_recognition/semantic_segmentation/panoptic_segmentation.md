# Panoptic Segmentation

Panoptic segmentation unifies **semantic segmentation** and **instance segmentation**. This means it not only labels every pixel but also distinguishes between individual object instances (e.g., separating two different cars in the same image).

- **Semantic Segmentation**: Labels every pixel based on a predefined set of categories (e.g., sky, road, person).
- **Instance Segmentation**: Identifies each object instance separately (e.g., two different people or cars are labeled individually).

This approach is critical in complex tasks like **autonomous driving**, **robotics**, and **surveillance**, where distinguishing between objects in real-time is essential.
