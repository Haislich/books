# Properties of the Harris Corner Detector

- **Locality**: Sensitive to local features.
- **Illumination Invariance**: Robust to changes in lighting.
- **Rotation Invariance**: Corners are detected irrespective of image orientation.
- **Partial Scale Invariance**: Can be extended to detect features across scales using a multi-scale approach.
- **Sensitivity to Perspective**: Less robust to perspective transformations without modifications.
