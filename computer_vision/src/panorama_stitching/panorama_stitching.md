# Panorama Stitching

Panorama stitching is a crucial technique in computer vision, applied across many fields to solve practical and complex problems. Below are key motivations for its importance:

- **Wider Field of View**: Panorama stitching enables the creation of images with a wider field of view than what can be captured by a single image. This is especially important in fields like real estate, where a comprehensive view of a property is needed, and in robotics, where a broader view assists in navigation and environmental understanding.
- **Higher Resolution**: By combining multiple images, panoramas achieve higher resolution and detail than individual images. This is vital for applications like digital mapping (e.g., Google Street View), where detailed, high-quality imagery is necessary for navigation and information extraction.
- **Immersive Experiences**: Panorama stitching is essential in creating immersive environments for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). These technologies rely on seamless panoramic images to deliver convincing experiences without visual discontinuities.

Panorama stitching enhances the capabilities of imaging devices by enabling broader and more detailed analysis, improving visual content creation, and addressing practical challenges in various industries that rely on computer vision.
