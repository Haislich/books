# Gradient Orientation

The orientation of the gradient reveals the direction of the greatest rate of increase in intensity from one pixel to another. It is perpendicular to the edge direction and provides the angle at which intensity changes occur, aiding in feature detection, such as in texture analysis or object recognition.

\[
\text{Orientation} (\theta) = \text{atan2}(G_y, G_x)
\]
