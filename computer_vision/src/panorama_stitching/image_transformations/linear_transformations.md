# Linear Transformations

Linear transformations include operations like translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing. These transformations are simple to compute and can be represented as matrix multiplications.

These include:

- **Rotation**: Changes the orientation of an image.
- **Scaling**: Alters the size of an image.
- **Shearing**: Skews the image along one axis.

They preserve linear relationships and distances between points and are expressed as matrix multiplications.
