# Key Elements of Epipolar Geometry

- **Epipolar Plane**: The plane that contains the baseline (line connecting the camera centers) and a point in the scene observed by both cameras.
- **Epipole**: The intersection of the baseline with the image plane of each camera. The epipole in one camera is the projection of the other camera's center.
- **Epipolar Line**: The line where the epipolar plane intersects the image plane. It constrains the search for corresponding points to this line, reducing the problem from 2D to 1D.
