# Monocular Depth Estimation

**Monocular Depth Estimation** refers to predicting depth information from a **single image**. Unlike stereo depth estimation, which uses two images from different viewpoints to calculate depth through triangulation, monocular depth estimation must infer depth based solely on visual cues within a single 2D image, making it a more challenging task.
