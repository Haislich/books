# Gradient Magnitude

The magnitude of the gradient at a pixel measures the strength of intensity changes, indicating the presence of edges or boundaries. High gradient magnitudes typically signal strong edges where intensity changes abruptly, while low values suggest flatter regions.

\[
\text{Magnitude} (G) = \sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2}
