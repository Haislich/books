# Image sampling

Sampling refers to the process of selecting a subset of data from a continuous signal or from a larger set of data points. In the context of image processing, this often relates to the initial acquisition of digital data from an analog source (like converting light captured by a camera sensor into pixel values) or selecting specific pixels or regions from an existing digital image for analysis or processing.
