# Pinhole Camera Model

The pinhole camera model is a simplified and idealized representation that assumes an infinitely small aperture (pinhole) through which light rays pass to form an image on the image plane. It ignores lens effects like distortion, making it a practical model for many applications due to its simplicity.

In this model, 3D points from the scene are projected through the pinhole onto a 2D image plane, with depth relationships preservedâ€”distant objects appear smaller than closer ones. The image is formed behind the pinhole at a distance determined by the **focal length (f)**.

Since the pinhole camera model does not account for lens distortion, it is ideal for scenarios where precise projection without optical corrections is needed.
