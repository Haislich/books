# Key Steps in Panorama Stitching

1. **Feature Detection**:  
   The first step in image stitching involves detecting distinctive features in each image. These features should be invariant to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination. Common algorithms include:

   - **SIFT** (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
   - **ORB** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

   These algorithms identify keypoints such as corners, edges, or unique patterns that signify significant content changes.

2. **Feature Matching**:  
   After detecting keypoints, the next step is to find corresponding features between different images. This typically involves using feature descriptorsâ€”unique signatures that describe features invariant to transformations. Popular algorithms like SIFT and SURF compute descriptors for each keypoint, capturing the local appearance around each point and maintaining invariance to changes in scale, rotation, and lighting.

3. **Transform Model Estimation**:  
   Once features are matched between images, the geometric transformation that aligns one image with another is estimated. Depending on the camera motion, this transformation could be:

   - Simple translation
   - Rotation
   - Complex models like affine or homography transformations

   Algorithms such as **RANSAC** (Random Sample Consensus) are commonly used to estimate the best transformation robustly by iteratively selecting a subset of matches, estimating the transformation, and verifying its alignment across all matches.

4. **Image Warping and Transformation**:  
   After determining the transformation model, it is applied to warp the images to align them. This involves adjusting the pixels of one or more images to ensure that corresponding features in the images match.

5. **Image Blending**:  
   Finally, the aligned images must be blended together to create a seamless panorama. Blending techniques manage overlaps, ensure color consistency, and smooth transitions between images. Common methods include:

   - **Multi-band blending**: Blends images at different scales for better visual quality.
   - **Alpha blending**: Facilitates gradual transitions between images to avoid abrupt changes.

By following these steps, a high-quality panoramic image is produced, enhancing the final result in terms of both visual quality and practical application.
multi-band blending, which blends images at different scales, or alpha blending, which facilitates gradual transitions between images, can be used to enhance the visual quality of the panorama.
