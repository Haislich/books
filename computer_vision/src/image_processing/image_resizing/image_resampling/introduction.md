# Image resampling

Resampling is about modifying an existing dataset (changing the pixel grid of an image) through processes like interpolation or decimation.
This typically involves creating a new set of data points from the original dataset under conditions where you're changing the grid, spacing, or orientation of the data.

Resampling is used when the existing dataset’s spatial arrangement doesn’t fit the needed application, such as when scaling images to a new resolution, rotating them, or applying other geometric transformations that alter their original grid structure.
