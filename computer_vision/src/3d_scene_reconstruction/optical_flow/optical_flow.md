# Optical Flow

Optical flow is a concept in computer vision that represents the pattern of apparent motion of objects, surfaces, and edges in a visual scene, as perceived through variations in image brightness across frames.
This apparent motion arises when there is relative movement between an observer (such as a camera) and the scene being observed.

In essence, optical flow captures the displacement of pixels between consecutive video frames, representing this motion as a vector field, where each vector indicates the direction and speed of motion at that point in the image.

Optical flow allows for the analysis of the dynamics within a scene
It is crucial for understanding how objects or features move over time, which is important for tasks such as object tracking and predicting future positions.

By analyzing the motion of points in a scene, optical flow can also contribute to the 3D reconstruction of scene geometry.
