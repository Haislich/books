# Relation with Gaussian Pyramids

A Gaussian Pyramid is created by repeatedly reducing an image's resolution, applying Gaussian blurring at each step. This process produces a stack of progressively lower-resolution images. Gaussian blurring ensures that high-frequency content is removed before subsampling, which prevents aliasing and adheres to the Nyquist criterion.
