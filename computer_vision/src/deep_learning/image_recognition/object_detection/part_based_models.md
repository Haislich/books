# Part-Based Models

Part-based models aim to detect objects by identifying their constituent parts (e.g., detecting individual wheels and body parts for a car). These models account for variation in pose and orientation, but they suffered from high inference times and often underperformed compared to simpler methods like HOG-SVM.
