# Image resizing

Image resizing is a fundamental operation in image processing that involves changing the dimensions of an image.
This can mean scaling up to make the image larger, or scaling down to make it smaller.
Effective image resizing techniques are crucial for a wide range of applications, from multimedia processing to machine learning, where images need to be normalized to a consistent size.
