# Disadvantages of DETR

- **Computational Efficiency**: The self-attention mechanism used in DETR has quadratic complexity, making it slower to train compared to traditional CNN-based object detectors.
- **Difficulty with Small Objects**: DETR sometimes struggles with detecting small or densely packed objects because the query embeddings may fail to represent them adequately.
