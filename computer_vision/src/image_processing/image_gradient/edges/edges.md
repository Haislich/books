# Edges

Edges are points where the image brightness changes abruptly, often indicating the boundaries of objects or significant variations in the scene. They are critical in image processing for tasks like segmentation and object recognition. Image gradients are directly related to edge detection since they emphasize regions with notable intensity changes.

- **Gradient Magnitude**: High magnitudes indicate strong intensity changes, likely marking the location of edges.
- **Gradient Orientation**: Points in the direction of the steepest intensity increase and is perpendicular to the edge direction.
