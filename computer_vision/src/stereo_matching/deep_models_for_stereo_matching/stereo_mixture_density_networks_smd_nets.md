# Stereo Mixture Density Networks (SMD-Nets)

SMD-Nets use mixture density networks to predict high-resolution disparity maps by modeling the probability distribution of disparities for each pixel. This probabilistic approach improves handling of ambiguities and occlusions, preserving edge details and structural integrity in complex scenes. SMD-Nets provide sharper and more accurate disparity maps, particularly in challenging environments.
