# Gradient Calculation

The gradient of an image is computed by taking derivatives in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Typically, this is done by convolving the image with derivative filters (kernels). The gradient consists of two components:

- **Horizontal Gradient** (\(G_x\)): Measures changes in intensity in the horizontal direction.
- **Vertical Gradient** (\(G_y\)): Measures changes in intensity in the vertical direction.

Partial derivatives represent the rate of change of image intensities with respect to the \(x\) and \(y\) directions independently. These derivatives provide insight into how pixel values vary across each dimension of the image.
