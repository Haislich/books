# Advantages of DETR

- **Unified Approach**: DETR integrates the object classification and bounding box prediction steps into a single model, unlike traditional methods that separate these tasks.
- **Global Context**: Thanks to the self-attention mechanism, DETR can model relationships between distant objects, something CNNs struggle to do.
- **Elimination of Anchors**: DETR removes the need for complex anchor box designs, simplifying the architecture and making training more straightforward.
