# Conclusion

Monocular depth estimation is a complex task that requires sophisticated models to extract 3D information from a single 2D image. While it poses significant challenges, such as scene ambiguity and occlusions, recent advances in deep learning, particularly in CNNs, Transformers, and self-supervised learning, have made it increasingly viable for real-world applications. With further research and improvements, monocular depth estimation holds great promise for enhancing depth perception in computer vision tasks across various domains.
