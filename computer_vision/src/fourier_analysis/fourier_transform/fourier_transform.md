# Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform extends the idea of Fourier series to non-periodic functions, providing a frequency spectrum for functions defined over all real numbers. The Fourier transform of a function \(f(t)\) is defined as:

\[
\hat{f}(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \, dt
\]

Where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency, and the integral is taken over the entire real line, capturing the function's values across time.
