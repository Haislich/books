# Hybrid Images

Hybrid images combine two images using multi-resolution techniques. One image retains only high-frequency information (details), and the other retains only low-frequency information (general shape). These images are combined by simple addition:

- At close viewing distances, the human eye perceives the high-frequency details of the high-pass filtered image.
- At farther distances, the eye naturally filters out finer details, leaving the broader, low-frequency features from the low-pass filtered image.

This results in an image that changes interpretation based on the viewing distance.
