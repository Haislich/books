# Common Types of Features

- **Edges**:  
  Edges represent boundaries where sharp changes in brightness occur. They are crucial for detecting objects, boundaries, and shapes within an image.

- **Corners and Interest Points**:  
  Corners are points where two or more edges meet. They are often used because they are invariant to translation, rotation, and changes in illumination. Interest points are distinct, recognizable pixels within the image that can be matched across different images of the same scene or object.

- **Blobs and Regions**:  
  Blobs are regions that differ in brightness, color, or other properties compared to surrounding areas. These are useful for detecting objects that are cohesive in terms of color or intensity.

- **Textures**:  
  Texture refers to the surface variations in intensity that suggest properties like material or surface quality. Texture features are valuable in classifying materials or objects based on their surface characteristics.
