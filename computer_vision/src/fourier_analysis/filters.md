- **Low Pass Filters (LPF)**: Allow low frequencies to pass through while attenuating high frequencies. In images, low frequencies represent smooth intensity variations, which are associated with general features and areas of uniform color. LPFs smooth the image, reducing noise and detail.
- **High Pass Filters (HPF)**: Allow high frequencies to pass while attenuating low frequencies. High frequencies represent rapid intensity changes, such as edges. HPFs enhance or detect edges, making them useful for edge detection and sharpening.
- **Band Pass Filters (BPF)**: Allow a specific band of frequencies to pass while blocking frequencies outside this range. BPFs can isolate frequencies within a chosen range, useful for focusing on specific details or textures in the image.
