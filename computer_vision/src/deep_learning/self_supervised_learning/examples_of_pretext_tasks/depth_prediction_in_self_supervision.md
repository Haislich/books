# Depth Prediction in Self-Supervision

In tasks such as **monocular depth estimation**, the model can learn depth from unlabeled video data. The pretext task here could be predicting the relative motion between consecutive frames (also known as **motion parallax**) to deduce depth information. This allows the model to infer 3D structures from 2D images.
