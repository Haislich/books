# SVD and QR Factorization

The least squares solution is obtained using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, which decomposes $\mathbf{A}$ into its singular vectors and singular values. Once the solution is found, **QR factorization** is used to extract the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from the projection matrix.
