# Pyramids

In computer vision, pyramids are a concept used to represent an image at different scales, typically to enable multi-scale processing and analysis. There are mainly two types of pyramids: Gaussian pyramids and Laplacian pyramids. Both types are utilized in various applications, such as image compression, feature extraction, image blending, and more efficient and effective image analysis.
