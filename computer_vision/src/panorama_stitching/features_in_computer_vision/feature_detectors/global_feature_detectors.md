# Global Feature Detectors

Global features describe characteristics of the entire image, such as its shape, texture, or color histogram. They summarize the image content as a whole rather than focusing on specific areas, making them ideal for:

- **Image classification**: The whole image defines a category, such as distinguishing between different types of landscapes.
- **Scene recognition**: The overall context or setting of the image is more important than individual elements within it.
