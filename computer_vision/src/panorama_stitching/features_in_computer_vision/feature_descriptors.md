# Feature Descriptors

Feature descriptors are numerical representations of image characteristics, typically extracted from specific regions or points of interest. While feature detectors identify significant points such as corners, edges, or blobs, feature descriptors provide a compact, robust, and informative description of these points. Descriptors aim to be invariant to variations in illumination, rotation, and scale, making them crucial for comparing and matching features across different images.

Once features have been detected, descriptors encapsulate information about the appearance and shape of the surrounding area to allow robust matching across images.
