# FREAK (Fast Retina Keypoint)

- **Approach**: Inspired by the human visual system, FREAK compares pixel intensities across a retinal sampling pattern. The pattern is denser near the center and sparser towards the periphery, mimicking retinal ganglion cells.
- **Advantage**: More robust to rotation and scale changes compared to BRIEF, with a lower computational cost than SIFT or SURF.
