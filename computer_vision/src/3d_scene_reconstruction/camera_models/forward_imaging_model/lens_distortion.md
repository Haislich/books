# Lens Distortion

Real cameras introduce **lens distortion**, causing non-linear displacements of points in the image. The two main types are:

- **Radial distortion**: Affects points based on their distance from the optical center, leading to compression or stretching near the edges.
- **Tangential distortion**: Occurs when the lens is misaligned with the sensor, causing a tilting effect.
