# Advantages of Self-Supervision

1. **Use of Unlabeled Data**:
   - Self-supervised learning allows models to leverage vast amounts of unlabeled data, which are easier to collect and more abundant than labeled data. This reduces the need for expensive and error-prone manual annotation.

2. **Better Representations**:
   - Models trained to solve general pretext tasks often learn more robust and generalizable representations than those trained on a specific supervised task. This allows them to transfer better to other tasks.

3. **Transferability**:
   - Models pre-trained using self-supervision can be fine-tuned for different downstream tasks with only a small amount of labeled data. This is similar to the way NLP models like GPT or BERT are pre-trained on large corpora and then fine-tuned for specific tasks.
