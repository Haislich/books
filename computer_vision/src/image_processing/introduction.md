# Image Processing

A general image processing operator is a function that takes one or more input images and procudes an output image.

An image can be thought as a function $f$ from $\mathcal{R}^2$ to $\mathcal{R}^3$.
Assume you have a point $p \in \mathcal{R}^2$:

$$
f(p) = \begin{bmatrix} r(p) \\ g(p) \\ b(p) \end{bmatrix}
$$

Where $r,g$ and $b$ are rispectively the reed, green and blue components of the image.
